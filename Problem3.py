#For this problem, write a program that calculates the area of a right triangle AND calculates its hypotenuse
    #This program should ask the user for the two leg sizes, AND should have error checking for invalid inputs
    #The formula for the area of a right triangle is (ab)/2, where a and b are the legs
    #The formula for a hypotenuse is a^2+b^2=c^2
        #to find square root in python, it is math.sqrt()

import math; #This needs to stay here to find the square root
