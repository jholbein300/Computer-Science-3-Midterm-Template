#For this problem, I want you to create a basic ATM
    #The first input asks "what is your account balance"
    #The second input asks "How much would you like to withdraw?"
        #Have error checking for this
            #If the user asks to withdraw more than what they have in their account, then ask them again with a warning message
            #if the user asks for an amount that is not a multiple of 5, then ask them again with a warning message
    #At the end, say "Money withdrawn! You have [amount] left in your account. Would you like to withdraw more?"
        #If they say "yes" then restart the program. If they say "no" then say "Have a great day!"
